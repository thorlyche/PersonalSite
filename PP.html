			Here is a fake paragraph I am pretending to write for my EECS 448 class<br>
			I have been wanting to make my own site for awhile now, and am very<br>
			grateful that it is an assigned project in 448. HTML is a lot easier than<br>
			I thought it would be. After uploading this to github I hope to change a lot<br>
			about this webpage, and even buy my own domain. I want to upload a resume, an<br>
			experience page, and maybe a short bio about myself for employers to see.

		<p class= "regularFont">
			This is my regular paragraph without colors or background colors, all it does is<br>
			grow when you hover over it. Here is a link to <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a><br>
			Here is a funny video I like <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xUlJ_6WHfh8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
